Shingles isn't something you'd expect to hear about in someone my age. At 27, I thought I was too young to worry about health issues like this. But life had other plans.

### The Onset
I was in between jobs, a stressful period to begin with. I had just been laid off at the end of March and was about to start a new job at the end of April. Then, in the first week of May, it hit meâ€”shingles, and not just a mild case. It was severe, covering half of my head and even affecting my eye.

### The Severity
I had to see an ophthalmologist every other day for weeks. The pain was excruciating, and the stress of potentially losing my vision made it even worse. It was a wake-up call, a glaring sign that my body was screaming for a break.

### The Trigger
The timing couldn't have been more telling. I got shingles right after starting a new job, a clear indication that stress was the trigger. It's a harsh lesson about the toll that stress can take on your body, even if you're young and otherwise healthy.

### Lessons Learned
This experience was a reality check. It made me reevaluate how I manage stress and prioritize my health. It's easy to get caught up in the hustle, especially when you're young and ambitious. But at what cost?

If you're young and think you're invincible, think again. Stress is a silent killer that doesn't discriminate based on age. Take it from me; it's better to address it now than to be forced to do so later, under much worse conditions.
